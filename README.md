## üéØ Overview

**Step into tranquility.** This is a collaborative project focused on creating a detailed and atmospheric **Japanese Temple environment** using **Unreal Engine 5.5.1**. This project serves as both a **learning exercise** and a **portfolio piece**, showcasing skills in environment art, level design, lighting, material creation, and collaborative workflows within UE5 using industry-standard tools like Maya, ZBrush, Substance Painter, and Photoshop.

Our goal is to build a visually captivating scene leveraging modern Unreal Engine features, with one team member focusing on creating high-quality **3D assets** and the other integrating them into a cohesive and immersive **level design**. The project is internally referred to as `JP_Temple`.

---

## ‚ú® Key Goals & Features (Planned/In Progress)

*   üèØ **Detailed Japanese Temple Environment:** Crafting an authentic-feeling temple scene with surrounding natural elements.
*   üé® **High-Quality Custom Assets:** Collaboration involves dedicated creation of 3D models and textures tailored for the scene using Maya, ZBrush, Substance Painter, and Photoshop.
*   üí° **Atmospheric Lighting & Mood:** Utilizing Unreal Engine's lighting and post-processing systems (e.g., Lumen, Nanite where applicable) to achieve a specific aesthetic.
*   üß± **Modular Design Approach:** Building the environment using modular assets for flexibility and efficient iteration.
*   üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Exploration Focus:** Designing the layout to encourage visual exploration and appreciation of detail within the Japanese Temple scene.
*   ü§ù **Collaborative Workflow:** Demonstrating effective teamwork between 3D asset creation and level integration/design within Unreal Engine.
*   üìö **Learning & Portfolio:** Serving as a practical application and demonstration of UE5 environment art skills and proficiency in the associated 3D toolchain.

## üíª Technology Stack

*   **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5.5.1 ‚öôÔ∏è
*   **Core Logic/Integration:** Blueprints üìò (Primarily for level setup, potentially minor interactions)
*   **Rendering Features:** Aiming to utilize Lumen, Nanite (as appropriate for assets) ‚ú®
*   **Asset Types:** 3D Models (.fbx), Materials, Textures, Level Sequences (potentially for flythroughs) üé®
*   **Collaboration Tools:** GitHub üíæ
*   **3D Modeling Software:** Autodesk Maya, ZBrush üõ†Ô∏è
*   **Texturing/Image Editing Software:** Adobe Substance Painter, Adobe Photoshop üñåÔ∏è

---

## üìä Project Status (Early Development)

*   ‚úÖ **Project Initialization:** Empty UE 5.5.1 project created.
*   ‚úÖ **Initial Folder Structure:** Core content directories (`Assets`, `Materials`, `Master`, `Scenes`, `Textures`) established within `/Content/JP_Temple/`.
*   ‚è≥ **Blockout Phase:** Currently blocking out the main layout and scale of the Japanese Temple environment within Unreal Engine.
*   ‚è≥ **Asset Creation:** Initial mood board and references gathered; 3D asset creation by the designer is beginning/planned based on blockout using Maya/ZBrush/Substance Painter/Photoshop.
*   üéØ **Next Steps:** Finalize blockout, begin integrating initial custom assets, start basic lighting pass.

## üå± Learning & Development Focus

This project provides opportunities to learn and demonstrate proficiency in:

*   Collaborative workflows between asset creation (using tools like Maya, ZBrush, Substance Painter, Photoshop) and level design in UE5.
*   Modular environment construction techniques for a Japanese Temple setting.
*   Advanced material creation and texturing.
*   Atmospheric lighting using Lumen and other UE5 features.
*   Scene composition and visual storytelling through environment design.
*   Optimizing complex scenes for performance (future goal).

---

## üîÆ Future Plans / Potential Enhancements

*   ‚ú® **Refine & Detail:** Add intricate details, decals, foliage, and polish existing assets/materials for the Japanese Temple.
*   üí° **Advanced Lighting Scenarios:** Experiment with different times of day or weather conditions.
*   üé¨ **Cinematic Flythroughs:** Create Sequencer shots showcasing the environment.
*   üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Basic Interactivity:** Potentially add simple interactions or ambient effects (e.g., opening doors, wind effects).
*   üß© **Expand the Scene:** Increase the scope of the Japanese Temple environment (e.g., add surrounding areas, interiors).
